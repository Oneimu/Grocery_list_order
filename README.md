# Grocery_list_order
I have a list of items I want to buy from a Walmart store down my street; The mall is really big, and it would take me hours to sort out the items from each row, I am not familar with the mall.
I have written a code that helps me speed up my shoping time; having collected the grocery layout (this entails the order of arragement of goods in the store) from the Walmart mall in my area, I created a sort algorithm that sorts my list into a given row/area in which each item can be find. 

PS. Walmart represents a grocery store, and I didn't meet with Walmart for any data, basically this is a demo discription for a demo algorithm.
